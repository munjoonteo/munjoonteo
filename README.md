### Hi there!

I'm Mun Joon (he/him), a final year Software Engineering student at UNSW and aspiring software engineer based in Sydney, Australia. I currently lead the development of [Notangles](https://notangles.csesoc.app), a timetabling application for students at UNSW.

I have experience in full-stack web development, especially React and Express. I have also been tinkering with some more low-level code in my C++ chess engine.
